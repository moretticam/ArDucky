## Configuration
Before uploading the code to the board you need to modify the `Configuration.h` file to configure and check some parameters 
such as the keyboard layout or the correct pins on all components. Be sure to select `Remote 1` in both Configuration files 
for RF usage. You can review the `ConfigurationProMicro.h` file to see the connection to a SparkFun ProMicro board.
